## Introduction:
Hello! We are very happy that you decided to work on our programming assignment, it will be fun, we promise!
The idea of the exercise is to see how you can create a crawler for Amazon products

### Description:
We want you to retrieve data from Amazon and make it available through an API such as CLI or REST API. The API should allow you to specify the product and the data we expect (e.g. titles, bidders, ratings, etc.).

### API:
The API should be dynamic and responsive to user parameters.

## Frameworks
Please use Node.js; otherwise you can take what you want.

P.S: if you have enough time you can also write some Unit tests ;-)
